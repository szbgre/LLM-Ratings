Therefore, there are 2^10 = 1024 different possible assignments of truth values to the variables.\n\nSince a tautology must be true under every possible assignment, all 1024 assignments must evaluate the formula to true. However, for each assignment, there is another assignment in which all the truth values of the variables are negated, resulting in the same formula being true. Therefore, there are a total of 2 * 1024 = 2048 models for the tautology.",
