Ackermann's reduction replaces uninterpreted functions with a set of constants and function symbols that represent all possible results of the functions. Bit-blasting converts the formula into a propositional formula by explicitly enumerating all possible values for the constants and function symbols.\n\nAfter applying Ackermann's reduction and bit-blast, the formula will be in propositional logic form, and we can use a standard SAT solver to check its satisfiability.\n\nBoth approaches, lemmas-on-demand with congruence closure and Ackermann's reduction with bit-blast, can be effective in solving formulas over the theory of uninterpreted functions.
