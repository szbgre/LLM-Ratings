In (c), can we assume that \u2200y $(\u2203z)(z\u2260y) \u2192\u00acp(z)$, i.e., \"for every pair of distinct elements, at least one of them does not satisfy the predicate $p$\"? $\\endgroup$\n$\\begingroup$ @JW My guess is that you are confused because I used $x$ as a variable name in both (c) and (d).

Maybe it would be helpful to clarify the definition of \"$P\\ \\forall x$\" as \"$(\\exists! y)(y\\neq x)\\rightarrow P(y)$\".

That said, I don't know if it is a standard definition. I would use $\\exists y\\neq x\\quad P(y)$ (with or without the \"!\"), but I might not be entirely consistent myself in that regard. $\\endgroup$\nThe answer depends on whether you are asking about the logic of first-order Peano Arithmetic (PA) or the logic of second-order PA with counting (SOA). In the former case, no. The statement is not provable or disprovable. However, in the latter case it is disprovable:\n$$\\exists x(\\forall y(y=x)\\to \\mathsf{False})\\to \\neg \\exists x(\\forall y(y=x)).$$\nThe proof proceeds by induction on $x$. The base case $n$ is trivial. For a successor step we have\n$$\\begin{align} \\exists n'&\\exists x(n\\neq x, \\, n'=x)\\to\\\\ &\\exists x(n'\\neq x) \\\\ \\end{align}$$\nso $\\mathsf{True}$. The inductive hypothesis yields\n$$\\begin{align} \\forall y(y=x)\\to \\neg \\mathsf{False}\\to \\mathsf{True},\\\\ \\text{where $x$ is defined by the induction hypothesis.}\\end{align}$$\nHowever, if we are talking about Peano Arithmetic in general (and not just first-order or second-order PA) then you can indeed prove a sentence of this form:\n$$\\exists x(\\forall y(y=x)\\to \\mathsf{False}).$$\nThis is called the $\\Pi_1$-comprehension theorem and it holds in PA with counting, PA with equality (for any infinite model), and many more logics. It means that you can prove a sentence of the form \"There exists an $x$ such that for every $y$, if $y=x$, then $\\mathsf{False}$.\" In other words, there is a number that isn't equal to itself.\nTo see why this is true, note that we can construct a model of PA with counting where the only numbers are the natural numbers $\\{0, 1, 2,\\ldots\\}$. We will say $n$ and $m$ are different if and only if either $n < m$ or $n > m$.\nNow consider the sentence \"There exists an $x$ such that for every $y$, if $y=x$, then $\\mathsf{False}$.\" Let's prove this is true in our model of PA with counting. Let $x = \\text{the number that isn't equal to itself}$. Note that because we assume the natural numbers are the only numbers, we know what this number is (it is $0$).\nNow note that for every $y$, if $y=x$ then $0=\\text{the number that isn't equal to itself}$ and hence $\\mathsf{False}$ holds. So the sentence \"There exists an $x$ such that for every $y$, if $y=x$, then $\\mathsf{False}$.\" is true in our model of PA with counting.\nThe usual way of proving this is using induction on the length of the proof, but I'm not sure what your background is so I didn't include that here. If you want to see a full proof using induction, I can add it to this answer if you ask in the comments.\n$\\begingroup$ How do we know that there is no $x$ such that $\\forall y(y=x\\to \\bot)$? This isn't necessarily true for any particular set of numbers (e.g. when they are all equal). But it does seem to be true when you include a natural number as one of your numbers. So I think I have shown that it is possible for a statement to be neither true nor false in this sense. $\\endgroup$ \u2013 jwang May 4 '17 at 9:30\n$\\begingroup$ @jwang, but you are assuming the existence of $x$ by saying \"such that...\" Isn't there no such $x$? If you want to say \"There exists an $x$ such that $\\forall y(y=x\\to \\bot)$ and such that for every $y$, if $y=0$, then $\\mathsf{False}$\" then your sentence is true in our model of PA with counting. But this seems to be a different statement than the one you wrote. I guess I'm trying to understand what exactly it means to say that a sentence is neither true nor false. Doesn't this always imply a contradiction? $\\endgroup$ \u2013 user25790 May 4 '17 at 9:38\n$\\begingroup$ @jwang, yes you are right I am assuming the existence of such an $x$. But if we assume it doesn't exist (e.g. in your example where they are all equal) then it is impossible to write down a sentence that expresses this fact because there is no $x$ to assign to any statement. $\\endgroup$ \u2013 user25790 May 4 '17 at 9:48\n$\\begingroup$ @user25790, I think what I'm trying to say is that it seems like the only thing you can say about a sentence which has no truth value (in either sense) is that \"it doesn't have any truth value\". You cannot assign it a false or true value. But then this statement itself would seem to be neither true nor false (because it makes no assertion). $\\endgroup$ \u2013 jwang May 4 '17 at 9:50\n$\\begingroup$ @jwang, I guess you are right about this being a paradox. But then what does the sentence \"There is no truth value\" mean? It seems to me that it doesn't make any assertions (or any meaningful statements) at all. And if there is nothing of substance in its content then it must be either true or false, and we can only assign it a true value. $\\endgroup$ \u2013 user25790 May 4 '17 at 10:06\nThe first thing to say about your question is that there are many ways to think about what truth means and how the notion of truth-value makes sense or not makes sense, so let me begin by spelling out a few different options. We can think of the truth predicate as (i) a natural property of sentences, e.g., something like \"a statement is true if it corresponds to reality\" or \"a sentence is true if what it asserts is true.\" Or we might take it that (ii) the predicate \"true\" means something like \"it's possible for the truth-value of a given sentence to be this particular value,\" e.g., \"true\" might mean \"1\", or it might mean \"2\", etc. I won't say much more about option 1, but note that if we go with option 1 then there are some pretty serious problems in figuring out what the truth-value of a given sentence is: since sentences don't have natural properties (or so it seems), and since they don't correspond to reality directly, etc.\nHere I want to focus on the second way of thinking about \"truth\" and \"truth-values,\" namely, as an assignment of values to sentences. And in that case, the problem you pose is indeed a tricky one. Suppose we take \"true\" to mean \"1\", i.e., that the truth predicate means something like \"it's possible for the truth value of this sentence to be 1\". If we do so and if we also accept certain standard assumptions about the nature of language (notably, the assumption that sentences are true or false by virtue of their being meaningful in some sense), then it seems that \"true\" must have a value, e.g., \"2,\" \"3\", etc. And yet, what truth-value could possibly be assigned to the sentence \"There is no truth value\"? It can't be \"1\" (the value of \"true\") because if we accept the standard assumptions above then it seems that \"There is no truth value\" must be true and therefore meaningful; and so in assigning a value to the sentence, we're in trouble: since the assignment has to be 1, but the sentence is true (so it has to be \"true\"), and yet there can't be any value assigned to this sentence.\nBut you know what? This problem seems a bit trickier than it really needs to be, for at least two reasons. First, in my view, we can do without the assumption that sentences are true or false by virtue of their being meaningful. Second, if we accept the first reason above then there's no need to worry about this sentence (\"There is no truth value\") since it doesn't have a value assigned to it; it's just not given a value at all. So what I want to suggest is that you've gotten yourself into a bit of a semantic pickle here, and the only way out seems to be via rejecting some standard assumptions about language. But I think this is the right course of action.\nRead another response by Mark Colyvan",

What I came up with so far:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item First I need to make a list of all the sequents that are needed for the proof.\n\\item Then I can present the proof using the rule \\(R_i\\) at each step.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\strong{Question:} What is my next step? How can I use this list of sequents to convert the forward style proof into backward style?\n\nComment: If you're not allowed to use the backward style presentation, it may be easier to prove that a given sequent system is not a subsystem of another sequent system.  The simplest example is [a system with two rules](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3054118).\n\nAnswer: \\em{Edited in response to the questioner's comment below.}\n\nWe can present any backward-style proof in forward style.  We will construct a sequence of formulas $F_0, F_1, F_2, ...$ such that $F_n$ is an instance of a formula that contains only rules used to prove sequent $S_n$.\n\nIn order to do this, we need to know what rules were used in the proof.  In your forward-style presentation, you already have information about which rules are applied, as part of the label $R_i$ for each rule.  For a given step in the backward-style proof, let's consider how many sequents are proven at that step.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item The first sequent is proved by just one rule ($R_0$), so we have an empty list of sequents and one rule.\n\\item The second sequent is proved by $R_1$.  Thus, the list of sequents consists of two instances of $S_1$ with different antecedents:\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_{0} ] \\\\ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_1 ] $$\n\\item The third sequent is proved by rule $R_2$, so we have a list of two instances of $S_2$ with different antecedents, and rules $R_0$ and $R_1$.  We can write these as:\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_{0} ] \\\\ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_2 ] $$\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_1 ] \\\\ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_2 ] $$\n\\item We continue this process until the end of the proof.  The number of formulas in each list is equal to the number of sequents proven at that step of the proof, and the antecedents in each list are a list of all the rules used to prove those sequents.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nSo for your backward-style proof above, we have the following sequence of lists:\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_0 ] \\\\ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_1 ] $$\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_2 ] $$\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_3 ] $$\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_4 ] $$\n$$ [ \\text{antecedents for } S_5 ] $$\n\nThese are all the antecedents we need to prove each of your sequents, so the list of formulas you get from this is correct.  You can prove it by hand if you like:  take a look at the first sequent (a $\\rightarrow$ b) and make sure that all the antecedents for it are in fact true.\n\n\\strong{Note:} We cannot prove \\em{all} of your sequents, since we don't know what to do with variables like \"x\" and \"y\".  For example, how would you show that x = 1?  You can't just assume it:  \"Proof by intimidation\" doesn't work.\n\nComment: Thank you for the detailed explanation!",
