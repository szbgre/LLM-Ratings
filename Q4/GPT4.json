However, this formula already uses only \u00ac and \u2228 operators so there's no need for transformation.\n\n2. \u00ac(a \u2194 b)\nTo represent the formula \u00ac(a \u2194 b) using only \u00ac and \u2228 operators, we must first understand that \"a \u2194 b\" represents \"a if and only if b,\" which is equalent to \"(a \u2227 b) \u2228 (\u00aca \u2227 \u00acb)\".

Therefore, we can see that the transformation via De Morgan's laws produced an equivalent formula that uses only the \u00ac and \u2228 operators.",
