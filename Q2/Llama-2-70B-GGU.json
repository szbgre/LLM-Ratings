Therefore, the number of models of a tautology is equal to the total number of possible assignments of values to its variables.\n\nIn this case, we have 10 different variables occurring in the formula, and each variable can take on two possible values (true or false). Therefore, the total number of possible assignments of values to these variables is 2^10 = 2048.\n\nHence, the correct answer is (c) 2048.",

However, $eg a$ and $eg b$ are both false because $a$ and $b$ are both false. Therefore, the sequent is not valid.\n\nNow, let's show that the formula is satisfiable. We can construct a model where $a$, $b$, and $eg$ are all false.

Eliminate negative literals by introducing new propositional variables and clauses.\n2. Push negations inward to obtain CNF.\n3. Simplify the resulting formula by removing tautological or contradictory clauses.\n\nDuring this process, no new clauses are created, so the number of clauses remains the same. If the original formula is satisfiable, then the transformed formula must also be satisfiable. Moreover, since only positive literals are used in the transformed formula, it is possible to derive the empty clause by resolving any two complementary literals (i.e",
