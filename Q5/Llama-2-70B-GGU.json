This implementation uses a simple DPLL algorithm. The solver is in the file dpll.c and it can be used as follows: $ limboole input.lp The program reads an integer n (default 3) from standard input, then reads n clauses from standard input and tries to find a solution for them. If no solution is found within 10000000 iterations, the program outputs 'no'. Otherwise it outputs 'yes' followed by the values of the variables that satisfy the clauses.
