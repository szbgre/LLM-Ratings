    "output": "One way we might approach this problem involves understanding how other Boolean connectives may be expressed using negation and implication. Specifically, we might realize that 'or' can be written in terms of 'not' and 'implies' as follows: a \u2228 b \u2194 \u00aca \u2192 b.\n\nUsing this, we can replace `(a \u2228 b) \u2228 c` with its semantic equivalent containing implication and negation:\n\n`\u00ac(\u00aca \u2192 b) \u2192 c`\n\nThis can be further simplified (using De Morgan's Laws) to:\n\n`\u00ac(\u00ac(\u00aca) \u2227 \u00acb) \u2192 c` \n\nwhich can be further simplified to:\n\n`(\u00ac\u00aca \u2228 \u00ac\u00acb) \u2192 c` \n\nor:\n\n`(a \u2228 b) \u2192 c` \n\nThis is a redundant simplification because it once again has the 'or' operation. It's important to note that any further attempts to simplify this formula would require introducing a new connective other than 'not' and 'implies'. \n\nHence, the most simplified form of the formula `(a \u2228 b) \u2228 c` using only implication and negation is ` \u00ac(\u00aca \u2192 b) \u2192 c`",

    "output": "(1) The formula $\\neg (a \\land b) \\vee (\\neg a \\land \\neg b)$ cannot be proven by sequent calculus since it's not valid.\n\nSequent calculus involves using logical inference rules to either prove a formula is a tautology (always true) or derive it from some set of hypotheses. However, this formula is not always true. To see this, consider the case where `a` is true and `b` is false. In this case, both sides of the disjunction `(a\u2227b)` would be false (`false\u2228false`), falsifying the whole formula. Thus, it's not valid and cannot be proven so by sequent calculus.\n\n(2) To show the satisfiability (this means finding an interpretation that makes the formula true) of this formula, we just need one interpretation of `a` and `b` that makes it true.\n\nOne possible interpretation is: \n\n    Let `a` = false and `b` = false\n\nThen $\\neg (a \\land b) \\vee (\\neg a \\land \\neg b)$ simplifies to:\n\n    NOT (false AND false) OR (NOT false AND NOT false)\n\nThis simplifies further to:\n\n    true OR (true AND true)\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n    true\n\nSince we found an interpretation of `a` and `b` that makes the formula true, we have shown that the formula is satisfiable.",
