    "output": "(1) The formula $\\neg (a \\land b) \\vee (\\neg a \\land \\neg b)$ cannot be proven valid using sequent calculus because it is a tautology, and tautologies are not considered valid in sequent calculus. A tautology is a statement that is always true regardless of the values assigned to its variables. In this case, the formula is a tautology because it can be simplified to $\\neg (a \\land b) \\vee \\neg (a \\land b)$, which is always true.\n\n(2) To show the satisfiability of this formula, we can provide a truth assignment that makes the formula evaluate to true. Let $a$ and $b$ be two propositional variables. We can assign $a = false$ and $b = false$. Then, we have:\n\n* $\\neg (a \\land b) = \\neg (false \\land false) = \\neg false = true$\n* $\\neg a \\land \\neg b = false \\land false = false$\n\nTherefore, the formula evaluates to $\\true \\vee false = \\true$, which is satisfiable.\n\nNote that the satisfiability of a formula does not necessarily imply its validity. A formula can be satisfiable but still be invalid if it contains logical fallacies or inconsistencies. In this case, the formula is a tautology and is considered valid, but it is not considered a valid argument because it does not convey any meaningful information.",
